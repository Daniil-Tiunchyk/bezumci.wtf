# 🌀 NestJS Weather API

A deliberately chaotic NestJS API with random Braille documentation, Stalin-sorted users, and artificial delays. Perfect for testing API clients against unpredictable behavior!

## 🌪️ Features

- **Random Swagger Documentation** - Auto-generates docs with 50% Braille conversion
- **Caesars cypher** - all users data stored securely!
- **Stalin Sort** - "Sorts" users by eliminating disordered elements
- **Configurable Chaos** - Control response delays and error rates
- **Russian Roulette Endpoints** - Some routes might work... or might not
- **Braille Mode** - Because why not?
